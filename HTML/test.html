    <h3>Sadio Mane</h3>

 
    <p>He is happy on Merseyside, though he is, naturally, aware that several of Europe’s top clubs are keeping a close eye on his situation.
    And while Bezemer is understood to have met with Hasan Salihamidzic, the Bayern Munich sporting director, last weekend, 
    it is understood that the German giants are not interested in pursuing a summer move for Mane.</p>
    Bezemer also represents Konrad Laimer, the RB Leipzig midfielder, whom Bayern are targeting, and sources have told GOAL and Spox that the discussions centred on that, as opposed to Mane.
    Mane’s performances for Liverpool this season have been strong, particularly since the turn.
