    <h1>HTML Essential Training</h1>
    <h3>Formatting page content</h3>
    <p>
      In this series of exercises, we'll explore how to use HTML elements to
      format basic page content.
    </p>
    <h4>Adding headings</h4>
    <p>
      Headings help define the structure of the page and control the hierarchy
      of the content. You can use heading values ranging from a top level
      heading of h1 all the way down to the an h6. While there are several
      competing theories on the exact strategy to use when choosing headings,
      what really matters is that you are using them in an intelligent manner,
      to accurately reflect the importance of your content. It's also important
      to be consistent in how you use headings across your site, so deciding on
      when nd how to use headings is an important part of planning your site.

    <h4>Using paragraphs</h4>
    <p>
      The paragraph tag((p)) is one of the most basic formatting tags, and one
      that you'll use often. It indictates a paragraph of text, and should be
      used for each individual paragraph.
    </p>
    <h4>Line breaks</h4>
    <p>
      Occasionally you'll need to perform a "soft return." that is, created a
      new line without using a new paragraph. To do that in HTML, you use the
      line break tag ((br)). Line break tags are inline, meaning you can use
      them within headers and paragraphs, and don't requirea closing tag. Let's
      say you were formating and address, for example. You could use inline
      breaks to make sure each line of the address appeared on a separate line,
      but still remained within the same paragraph, lynda.com 6410 Via Real
