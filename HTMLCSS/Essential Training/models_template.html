    <h1>Content models</h1>
    <p>
      In HTML 4 there were ony two main content models, block and inline level
      elements. <b>Block level</b> elements would stack on top of each other in
      normaldocument flow while <b>inline level</b> elements typically appear
      within the flow of text content.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this example the <b>heading 1</b> and the <b>paragraphs</b> are block
      level items, while the bold tags and the link below are examples of inline
      level elements
    </p>

    <p>
      In HTML 5 new content models have been created to explain the structure
      and semantic capabilities of HTML. There are seven main models:
      <b
        >Flow, Metadata, Embeddde, Interactive, Heading, Phrasing, and
        Sectioning.</b
      >
